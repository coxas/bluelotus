        <h3 class="josefin">A New Perspective on Psychological Care</h3>
        <p class="josefin">Welcome to Blue Lotus Psychological Services! We are a boutique practice developed to address the client’s holistic health needs. As a clinical psychologist and Reiki Master, Anne-Marie C. Nicolas, Psy.D. combines her traditional clinical training with a holistic treatment perspective which incorporates the mind, body, and spirit of each client individually, respecting each person’s beliefs with compassion.</p> 
        <p class="josefin">From a young age, Dr. Nicolas has had a calling to assist others as they heal from psychological and spiritual wounds. She is descended from a family of healers including, most notably, her father Dr. Aristomene Nicolas, M.D., who was a renowned internist and pathologist in Chicago until his passing. Dr. Nicolas believes in the mind, body, and soul connection which is reflected in her practice. She believes in providing “care with integrity.”</p>
